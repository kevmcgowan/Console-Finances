# Unit 4 Challenge: Console Finances

## Overview

In this challenge, I have attempted to create an app that will analysis a set of figures 
contained within a Multi-Dimensional array.

## Instructions

1. Open your default browser.

2. Right click anywhere on the page and select Inspect form the pop-up menu.

3. From the inpection tool bar select console and refresh the page.

   


When you open your code in the browser your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:
